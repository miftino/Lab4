# Lab4

This project simulates a bank with a configurable number of tellers, to determine the optimal number needed to minimize customer wait time while avoiding overstaffing.

The bank receives a list of customers with their **arrival time** and **service duration**. The simulation runs from time `0` until all customers are processed.

The simulation runs with teller counts ranging from **2 to 10**, and prints out the **average process time** for each configuration.
